# Conflict Game Online

###Purpose:
To provide students with a more interactive experience while aiding in their understadning of conflict resolution concepts.

###Overview

The overall development of this program was done with [p5js](http://p5js.org/), a complete overhaul of the [Processing](https://processing.org/) environment into a Javscript library.

Students will run the program and open a html document with two characters on screen. Each character will use either Destructive or Constructive language and concepts. Students will enter input into the text boxes displayed on each scene. After each scene is competed, students will have a CSV file with their responses.

At this point in time, the program is almost all input based. More interactivity will be added over time (changing characters based on language used/scene being worked on, characters having text output instead of just text input, etc.)

**look in the gh-pages branch for the most up to date version of the game**
